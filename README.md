# BellyButtonDashboard
Module 13 Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard Challenge


## Objective
The objective of this assignment was to create an interactive dashboard where the participants can view the details and visualizations of their results from the Belly Button Biodiversity study. 

Participants are anonymous and are assigned a Subject ID that correlates to the dataset results for their sample.  Microbial species are identified as OTUs (operational taxonomic units). 

Participants can select an ID number to view the demographic data or the participant and visualizations of 3 areas: 
  1. Gauge graph showing belly button wash frequency per week
  2. A bar chart of the top 10 bacterial cultures found for that sample
  3. A bubble chart of the number and details of bacteria cultures per sample. 

## Tools
  - VSC was utilized to write the index.html, css, and js for the webpage. 
  - Bootstrap and d3 were utilized
  - Plotly was used for graphics.
